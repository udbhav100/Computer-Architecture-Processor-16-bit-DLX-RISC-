# Computer-Architecture-Processor-16-bit-DLX-RISC-

Designed a 16-bit DLX RISC Processor (Von Neumann architecture) on Verilog. It comprises CPU main components (ALU, Control Unit, IR Decoder, Registers). It supports operations like ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE, JUMP (based on values of flags), LSR, RSL. Control Signals and ALU Control was designed to perform these operations.
